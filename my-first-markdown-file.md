# Hello Markdown! 

It is **so** nice to be able to write in this simple format.

Once you get the hang of *it*, you just:

* Remeber the basic syntax
* Write your doc
* Done !

Now you can be a wizard at this new language and code up stuff like `console.writeLine("Hello Markdown!");`

Can't remember any of the features of the language? Just visit:
